A very basic react app styled with bootstrap uses; webpack, less and babel.

NB: only runs in browsers that support the new fetch web API.

# Run
npm install
npm run dev

# TODOs
* More test coverage and work out a consistent test strategy
* refactor css into real less
* Build / distribution support
